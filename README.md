# ML-Prediction-of-Thermochemistry-of-CHO-species

This code in various versions allows for the prediction of the thermochemistry values of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen containing species.

The code initially used on the WUDILY dataset features both fixed and learnable molecular featurization coupled with conventional and GNN ML methods.

Various versions would be updated depending on different types of applications of the code.
